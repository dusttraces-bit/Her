                <p class="mb-4">The 7th is almost here, and I feel like my heart is being pulled in two completely different directions. One part is so incredibly, overwhelmingly proud of you. You're about to step onto a plane and fly towards the dream you've worked so hard for. You are going to be a doctor. Just saying that fills me with a pride I can't even describe.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">But then there’s the other part of my heart. The selfish part that aches at the very thought of you leaving. I’m going to miss you so much it physically hurts to think about. The silence you leave behind will be deafening. Please, never for a moment doubt how much I will be missing you every single second of every single day.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">It's funny, isn't it? How this all started. Do you remember? I was just scrolling through my phone, and I saw your story… something about "Rebel Kid." I was so curious, but a hundred different voices in my head told me not to text. "Should I ask? What if she thinks I'm weird?" But then, a louder voice just said, "Fuck it. Just ask." And in that one moment, my entire world changed. I’m so incredibly glad it happened.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I never planned for you. There was no plan to text you or talk to you, it just happened. What started as a random DM slowly turned into the most important conversation of my life. I think I knew things were different when we started talking about relationships. When you told me you weren't into the whole Gen Z hookup culture, that you were looking for something real. In that moment, our vibes just matched perfectly. Everything just clicked. It was a "now or never" feeling, and suddenly, I knew I couldn't let you go.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">From that one random story, you’ve become my favorite story. You became this unexpected, brilliant light in my life. And now, I’m so into you that I’m willing to give it all to make things work with you.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Now, we face our biggest test: distance. Russia is so far away, and I won't pretend it's going to be easy. But I need you to get on that plane knowing that my heart isn't going anywhere. Just like I told you before, even with distance, even with silence, my heart hasn't shifted an inch. In fact, it’s only held on tighter. You are my peace. You are my home.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I need you to know this, now more than ever: I choose you. With no second thoughts, with no backup plan. Just you. And if you're still willing, I'm here, ready to build our future together, one step, one call, one day at a time. For you… I’m all in. I'm all in on the late-night video calls, on listening to you vent about your studies, on celebrating your successes from thousands of miles away, and on being the rock you can always count on.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">So, go. Go to Russia and be the brilliant, compassionate, amazing doctor you were always meant to be. Chase this dream with everything you have. And whenever you feel lonely, or scared, or homesick, I want you to re-read this and remember the boy who saw your story, took a chance, and found his entire world.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I love you. More than words can say, more than distance can measure.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">Fly safe, my future doctor. I’ll be right here waiting for you.</p>
                <p class="text-right font-semibold text-white signature">Always and forever yours,<br>Sujal ❤️</p>
